## Strategy Overview

The NASDAQ Top-N Momentum Strategy is a systematic investment approach that maintains portfolios of the largest companies by market capitalization. The strategy operates on the principle that the biggest companies (by market cap) tend to continue growing, making it a momentum-based approach.

### Key Principles:
- **Market Cap Focus**: Ranks all stocks by real-time market capitalization daily
- **Top-N Selection**: Maintains portfolios of the top 1, 2, 3... up to 10 largest companies
- **Momentum Capture**: Assumes largest companies continue to grow (momentum effect)
- **Threshold-Based Rebalancing**: Only trades when changes exceed a predefined threshold
- **Real-Time Execution**: All decisions made using market-open data, trades executed immediately

### Portfolio Variants:
- **Top-1**: Single largest company (highest concentration, highest volatility)
- **Top-2**: Two largest companies (high concentration, moderate diversification)
- **Top-3**: Three largest companies (balanced concentration/diversification)
- **Top-5 to Top-10**: Increasing diversification, decreasing concentration

## Data Sources and Quality

### Primary Data Source: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API

**Why FMP was chosen:**
1. **Premium Data Quality**: Professional-grade financial data with minimal errors
2. **Historical Accuracy**: Proper time-series alignment and survivorship bias correction
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 20+ years of historical data for market cap calculations
4. **Real Shares Outstanding**: Time-varying shares outstanding data for accurate market cap
5. **Adjusted Prices**: Proper dividend and split adjustments for backtesting

### Data Components:

#### 1. Historical Stock Prices
- **Open Prices**: Used for trade execution (rebalancing transactions)
- **Adjusted Close Prices**: Used for performance calculation
- **Why Adjusted**: Accounts for dividends, stock splits, and other corporate actions
- **Source**: `historical-price-full/{symbol}` endpoint

#### 2. Shares Outstanding Data
- **Primary Source**: Enterprise values endpoint (`enterprise-values/{symbol}`)
- **Fallback Source**: Key metrics endpoint (`key-metrics/{symbol}`)
- **Why Critical**: Market cap = Stock price × Shares outstanding
- **Time-Series Alignment**: Forward-filled to match daily price data

#### 3. Market Capitalization Calculation
```
Market Cap = Stock Price × Shares Outstanding
Real-Time Market Cap = Open Price × Shares Outstanding (at market open)
```

#### 4. Stock Universe Selection
- **Broad Universe**: ~500 major stocks across NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX
- **Survivorship Bias Correction**: Includes stocks that may have been delisted
- **Filters Applied**:
  - Price > $5 (excludes penny stocks)
  - Valid trading symbols (excludes indices, foreign ADRs)
  - Substantial historical data (>100 trading days)

### Alternative Data Source: Yahoo Finance
- **Free Option**: Available as fallback through Yahoo Finance API
- **Limitations**: Less reliable for precise historical market cap calculations
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, or when premium data not available

## Algorithm Operation

### Daily Process Flow:

#### 1. Market Open (9:30 AM EST)
```
FOR each trading day:
    1. Calculate real-time market caps using open prices
    2. Rank all stocks by market capitalization
    3. Determine if rebalancing is needed (threshold check)
    4. If rebalancing needed:
        - SELL stocks being removed from portfolio
        - BUY stocks being added to portfolio
        - Execute all trades at current open prices
    5. Track portfolio value using close prices at day end
```

#### 2. Real-Time Market Cap Calculation
```python
# At 9:30 AM market open
for each_stock:
    shares_outstanding = get_shares_outstanding(date)
    open_price = get_open_price(date)
    real_time_market_cap = open_price * shares_outstanding
    
# Rank stocks by real-time market cap
ranked_stocks = sort_by_market_cap(descending=True)
top_n_stocks = ranked_stocks[:n]
```

#### 3. Portfolio Composition Decision
- **Current Portfolio**: Stocks currently held
- **Target Portfolio**: Top-N stocks by current market cap
- **Change Detection**: Compare current vs. target portfolios
- **Threshold Check**: Only rebalance if change exceeds threshold

#### 4. Trade Execution
- **Timing**: Immediate execution at market open prices
- **Order Type**: Market orders (assumes immediate execution)
- **Position Sizing**: Equal-weight allocation (1/N for each stock)
- **Transaction**: All trades completed before market moves

### Key Technical Details:

#### Market Cap Data Pipeline:
1. **Price Retrieval**: Download historical adjusted prices
2. **Shares Retrieval**: Download historical shares outstanding
3. **Time Alignment**: Align price and shares data by date
4. **Forward Fill**: Extend shares data to match daily price data
5. **Market Cap Calculation**: Price × Shares for each trading day

#### Real-Time Simulation:
- **Decision Point**: Market open (9:30 AM EST)
- **Data Available**: Open prices and historical shares outstanding
- **Trade Execution**: Immediate at open prices
- **Performance Tracking**: Close-to-close daily returns

## Rebalancing Logic

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing System

The strategy uses a sophisticated threshold system to avoid excessive trading while capturing meaningful market cap changes.

#### Threshold Mechanism:
```
Current Threshold: 3.5% (configurable in config.py)

Rebalancing Triggered When:
Stock outside top-N has market cap > (Smallest portfolio stock market cap × 1.035)
```

#### Example: Top-2 Portfolio
```
Current Portfolio: [AAPL: $3.0T, MSFT: $2.8T]
Market Update: GOOGL reaches $2.9T market cap

Check: $2.9T > $2.8T × 1.035 = $2.898T
Result: YES → Trigger rebalancing
New Portfolio: [AAPL: $3.0T, GOOGL: $2.9T]
```

#### Threshold Benefits:
- **Reduces Trading Costs**: Prevents excessive rebalancing from minor fluctuations
- **Captures Meaningful Changes**: Only trades when market cap differences are significant
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted based on trading cost tolerance

#### Threshold Configuration:
- **Lower Values (1-2%)**: More frequent rebalancing, higher transaction costs
- **Higher Values (5-10%)**: Less frequent rebalancing, may miss opportunities
- **Current Setting**: 3.5% (balanced approach)

### Rebalancing Event Details:

#### When Rebalancing Occurs:
1. **Initial Portfolio Creation**: First trading day
2. **Market Cap Threshold Breach**: Stock outside portfolio exceeds threshold
3. **Corporate Actions**: Mergers, acquisitions, delistings

#### What Happens During Rebalancing:
1. **Portfolio Valuation**: Calculate current portfolio value at open
2. **Target Calculation**: Determine new top-N stocks
3. **Trade Generation**:
   - SELL orders for stocks being removed
   - BUY orders for stocks being added
4. **Equal Weighting**: Allocate 1/N of portfolio value to each stock
5. **Trade Execution**: All orders executed at market open prices

## Backtest Limitations

### Potential Inaccuracies vs. Real-World Results:

#### 1. **Perfect Execution Assumption**
- **Backtest**: Assumes all trades execute exactly at market open prices
- **Reality**: Market orders may have slippage, especially for large positions
- **Impact**: Real returns may be 0.1-0.5% lower per rebalancing event

#### 2. **Transaction Costs Not Included**
- **Backtest**: No commission, spread, or market impact costs
- **Reality**: Typical costs range from $0-$10 per trade (commissions) plus bid-ask spreads
- **Impact**: Large portfolios may see 0.05-0.15% drag per rebalancing

#### 3. **Liquidity Assumptions**
- **Backtest**: Assumes infinite liquidity at market open
- **Reality**: Large positions may move market prices during execution
- **Impact**: Significant for portfolios >$10M in individual stocks

#### 4. **Market Open Timing**
- **Backtest**: Perfect timing at exactly 9:30 AM
- **Reality**: Human execution may lag by 1-5 minutes
- **Impact**: Market cap rankings may change during execution window

#### 5. **Corporate Actions Handling**
- **Backtest**: Uses adjusted prices but may miss real-time impacts
- **Reality**: Mergers, spin-offs, delistings create execution complexity
- **Impact**: Temporary portfolio disruptions, forced liquidations

#### 6. **Survivorship Bias (Partially Addressed)**
- **Backtest**: Includes many delisted stocks but may miss some
- **Reality**: Complete universe includes all historically traded stocks
- **Impact**: Backtest may overestimate returns by 0.5-1% annually

#### 7. **Tax Implications Not Modeled**
- **Backtest**: Assumes tax-free trading
- **Reality**: Frequent rebalancing creates taxable events
- **Impact**: After-tax returns may be significantly lower in taxable accounts

#### 8. **Market Conditions Dependency**
- **Backtest**: Includes 2005-2025 period (mostly bull market)
- **Reality**: Future market conditions may differ significantly
- **Impact**: Strategy performance highly dependent on mega-cap stock performance

### Estimated Real-World Performance Adjustments:
- **Transaction Costs**: -0.2% to -0.8% annually (depending on rebalancing frequency)
- **Execution Slippage**: -0.1% to -0.3% annually
- **Market Impact**: -0.1% to -0.5% annually (for large portfolios)
- **Total Drag**: -0.4% to -1.6% annually from backtest results

## Profitability Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements:

#### 1. **Dynamic Threshold Management**
```python
# Current: Fixed 3.5% threshold
# Enhancement: Volatility-adjusted thresholds
if market_volatility > high_threshold:
    rebalancing_threshold = 5.0%  # Reduce trading in volatile markets
else:
    rebalancing_threshold = 2.0%  # Increase sensitivity in calm markets
```

#### 2. **Transaction Cost Optimization**
- **Batch Trading**: Combine multiple portfolio rebalances into single trading session
- **Time-of-Day Optimization**: Trade during high-liquidity periods (10 AM - 3 PM)
- **Order Type Selection**: Use limit orders with short timeouts instead of market orders

#### 3. **Enhanced Stock Universe**
- **Sector Diversification**: Limit concentration in any single sector
- **Quality Filters**: Add financial health metrics (debt ratios, profitability)
- **Growth Screens**: Include revenue growth, earnings growth factors

### Advanced Enhancements:

#### 4. **Multi-Factor Momentum**
```python
# Current: Pure market cap ranking
# Enhancement: Weighted scoring system
momentum_score = (
    0.5 * market_cap_rank +
    0.2 * price_momentum_3m +
    0.2 * earnings_growth +
    0.1 * analyst_upgrades
)
```

#### 5. **Risk Management Overlays**
- **Volatility Limits**: Exclude stocks with excessive volatility
- **Drawdown Protection**: Reduce exposure during market stress
- **Correlation Analysis**: Avoid highly correlated holdings

#### 6. **Regime-Based Adjustments**
- **Bull Market Mode**: Higher concentration (Top-3 focus)
