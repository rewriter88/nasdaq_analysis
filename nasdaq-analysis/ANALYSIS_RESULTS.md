# Investigation Results: Why Nasdaq Backtest Returns Are So High

## Summary of Findings

After thorough investigation of the extremely high backtest returns (e.g., Top 1 portfolio: +18,061%), I tested three main theories. **All three theories have been validated**, explaining why the returns are artificially inflated.

## Theory 1: Look-ahead Bias ✅ RULED OUT
**Status**: NOT the primary issue  
**Test Result**: Market cap rankings do change over time, indicating the system is not using future information for past decisions.

## Theory 2: Survivorship Bias ✅ CONFIRMED AS MAJOR ISSUE
**Status**: CRITICAL FLAW - This is a major contributor to inflated returns

### What's Happening:
- The analysis uses `get_nasdaq_constituents()` to get the **current** Nasdaq 100 list (101 stocks as of 2024)
- This current list is applied retrospectively to the entire 20-year period (2005-2024)
- **Missing companies**: All delisted, bankrupt, or removed companies are excluded from the analysis

### Examples of Missing Companies:
- ❌ YHOO (Yahoo) - acquired by Verizon
- ❌ DELL (Dell) - went private  
- ❌ RIMM (BlackBerry) - performance declined, removed from index
- ❌ WCOM (WorldCom) - bankruptcy
- ❌ ENRN (Enron) - bankruptcy
- ❌ PALM (Palm Inc) - acquired
- ❌ SUNW (Sun Microsystems) - acquired by Oracle
- ❌ AOL - various mergers

### Impact:
- **Only analyzing survivors**: The backtest only includes companies that were successful enough to remain in today's Nasdaq 100
- **Excluding failures**: Companies that failed, were acquired at low valuations, or declined significantly are completely missing
- **Artificial inflation**: Returns are artificially high because we're only looking at the winners

## Theory 3: Data Quality Issues ✅ CONFIRMED AS CRITICAL ISSUE  
**Status**: CRITICAL FLAW - This is another major contributor

### What's Happening:
The market cap calculation has a fundamental flaw in the `calculate_historical_market_cap()` function:

```python
# Line 210-214: Uses MOST RECENT shares outstanding for entire history
shares_outstanding = ev_data['numberOfShares'].dropna().iloc[-1]
```

### The Problem:
- **Static shares outstanding**: Uses today's share count for the entire 20-year period
- **Ignores stock splits**: Companies that had major stock splits (like AAPL, TSLA) would have severely distorted market caps
- **Ignores buybacks**: Share buyback programs over 20 years are completely ignored
- **Wrong historical ranking**: A company's market cap in 2005 is calculated using 2024 share counts

### Example Impact:
If Apple had 15B shares in 2024 but 25B shares in 2005 (pre-splits), using 2024's 15B shares would make Apple's 2005 market cap appear 67% higher than it actually was, artificially boosting its ranking in historical top-N selections.

## Combined Impact of Both Issues

### Survivorship Bias Effect:
- Portfolio selections are made from a universe of 101 pre-filtered winners
- Zero exposure to companies that failed or declined significantly
- Creates an unrealistic "best case scenario" universe

### Data Quality Effect:  
- Historical market cap rankings are severely distorted
- Companies appear larger in the past than they actually were
- Top-N selections are based on incorrect historical data

### Result:
These two major flaws combine to create artificially inflated returns:
1. **Input bias**: Only successful companies are considered (survivorship)
2. **Calculation bias**: Market cap rankings are based on incorrect historical data (data quality)

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix #1: Address Survivorship Bias
- Obtain historical Nasdaq 100 constituent lists for each rebalancing period
- Include companies that were delisted, acquired, or removed during the analysis period
- Consider using a broader universe (e.g., all Nasdaq stocks with minimum market cap)

### Fix #2: Fix Market Cap Calculation
- Use correct historical shares outstanding for each time period
- Implement proper time-series alignment of shares data with price data
- Account for stock splits, dividends, and share buybacks accurately

### Fix #3: Validation
- Compare results with published Nasdaq 100 index returns
- Validate against academic papers on momentum strategies
- Cross-check with professional backtesting platforms

## Conclusion

The extremely high returns (+18,000%+) are **NOT realistic** and are the result of two critical methodological flaws:

1. **Survivorship bias**: Only analyzing companies that succeeded
2. **Data quality issues**: Using incorrect historical market cap calculations

These findings explain why both the FMP and Yahoo Finance versions showed similarly inflated returns - both suffer from the same methodological issues. A properly implemented backtest with historical constituent data and correct market cap calculations would show significantly lower, more realistic returns.
